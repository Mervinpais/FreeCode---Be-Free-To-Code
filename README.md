<h1>FreeCode - Be Free To Code</h1>
<h4>FreeCode is a simple IDE for my other project which is a programming lanuage called <a href="https://github.com/Mervinpais/W14-Sharp-Coding-Language">W14# Coding Language</a></h4>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h4>The IDE is still in beta so expect Bugs in it</h4>
<h5>The Good news is you can edit the code to however you like since the ide uses my programming langauge W14# which is heavily Customisable and the only thing that you need to know before adding your stuff is to learn a bit of C# since the Project(W14#) uses C# to work so having some C# knowledge might help, especially when there are Errors :)</h5>
<h3>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>
<h4>When will there be support for other languages?</h4>
<h5>Ans: Ah yes, the answer is no. Until i can finish the IDE, sadly im only gonna support my Coding language(W14#) since its very easy to add(i literally just copyed the code and added some modifications for it work lol), but i might be able to make packages to download so you can get any language you need, example; Python,Java,C#,F# and more if i can</h5>
