<h1>FreeCode - Be Free To Code</h1>
<h4>FreeCode is a simple IDE for my other project which is a programming lanuage called <a href="https://github.com/Mervinpais/W14-Sharp-Coding-Language">W14# Coding Language</a></h4>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h4>The IDE is still in beta so expect Bugs in it</h4>
<h5>The Good news is you can edit the code to however you like since the ide uses my programming langauge W14# which is heavily Customisable and the only thing that you need to know before adding your stuff is to learn a bit of C# since the Project(W14#) uses C# to work so having some C# knowledge might help, especially when there are Errors :)</h5>
<h3>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>
<h4>When will there be support for other languages?</h4>
<h5>Ans: Ah yes, the answer is no. Until i can finish the IDE, sadly im only gonna support my Coding language(W14#) since its very easy to add(i literally just copyed the code and added some modifications for it work lol), but i might be able to make packages to download so you can get any language you need, example; Python,Java,C#,F# and more if i can</h5>
<h4>Why are there SOO MANY BUGS?!</h4>
<h5>Ans: Its because i have no-one to help me on the project so i first focus on fixing bugs but then i make one mistake an no-one is there help soo :(
Im ok being alone since i dont want to boss around everyone so if you can point out bugs and how to fix then THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING YOU COULD DO FOR ME!! so please, if you are a developer, please help me out. I might use XML or vba or Visual basic to help but fornow, the whole project will be based on c#</h5>
