<!--href = "/code_for_freecode.html"-->
Note: Code is below

lets say i wanted to detect some text(specific ones) the C# code would be
```
string text_i_want = "bruh";//replace the text in quotes with what you want
foreach (line in textbox1)
{
  if (line.Contains(text_i_want))
  {
    consoleTextBox.Text += "why did you say bruh";//replace the text in quotes with what you want
  }
}
```
the output would be
```
whatever
```
