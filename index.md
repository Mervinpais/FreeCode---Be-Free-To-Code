<p style="color: #42A5F5;">Welcome to the FreeCode Github website!

<p style="color: #42A5F5;">I love to share my code to fellow programers so please, click below if you want to know how the Code works :3</p>
<a>[REMOVED]</a>
<!--href = "/code_for_freecode.html"-->
Note: Code is below

<h4 style="color: #42A5F5;">lets say i wanted to detect some text(specific ones) and display them as output (like a normal programing language would WITH an IDE) the C# code would be</h4>
```
string text_i_want = "bruh";//replace the text in quotes with what you want
foreach (line in textbox1)
{
  if (line.Contains(text_i_want))
  {
    consoleTextBox.Text += "why did you say bruh";//replace the text in quotes with what you want
  }
}
```
<p style="color: #42A5F5;">the output would be</p>
```
(in the textbox)why did you say bruh
```
<h4 style="color: #42A5F5;">BUT lets say i wanted a console application instead<h3 style="color: red;">(ALERT, THIS WAS NOT TESTED!!, IT MAY NOT WORK!!)</h3></h4>
```
string text_i_want = "bruh";//replace the text in quotes with what you want
foreach (line in textbox1)
{
  if (line.Contains(text_i_want))
  {
    Console.Writeline("why did you say bruh");//replace the text in quotes with what you want
  }
}
```
<p style="color: #42A5F5;">the output would be</p>
```
why did you say bruh
